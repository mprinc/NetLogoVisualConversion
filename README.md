NetLogoVisualConversion is a python 2.7 script that helps you to use your [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) created networks in many Network Visualizing tools (like [Gephi](http://gephi.org/), [Guess](http://graphexploration.cond.org/) or similar)

## WHY
* recover all parameters of your netlogo world in Gephi
    * turtles -> nodes
    * links -> edges
    * nodes positions are preserved
        * you can keep and observe a specific topology that is created through NetLogo model
    * nodes sizes and colors are preserver
        * it is very usefull if they reflect some internal network characteristics
    * edge weights are preserved
    * breeds of turtles and edges are preserved
        * you can use that to encode special node/edges characteristics, like opinions, or type of connections between nodes, etc
* igraph model
    * if you did a bit of programmming you can extend script and play with intermediate igraph model that we go through before exporting to GraphML document
* transition parameters
    * nodes sizes scaling
    * nodes positions scalling
    * edges weights scaling
    * ignoring edge weight
    * prefixing node names

### Nice to have features?
If you think that features from the following list would be nice to have, please let me know
* GraphML -> NetLogo
* NetLogo time -> GraphML dynamic

## Examples

You can download script by clicking on 'ZIP' button on the top of the page or simple following the link:

[Download link](https://github.com/mprinc/NetLogoVisualConversion/archive/master.zip)

after downloading script, unpack it and run it in the following way:

`python src/convert.py`

You will see a list of parameters you can provide and a list of necessary parameters.

Here are some examples of calling script:

```bash
`python src/convert.py --phase convert --filein "data/examples/NetLogo/netlogo world - cliques.csv" \
    --fileout "data/examples/Gephi/conversions/converted - netlogo world - cliques.graphml"
```

```bash
python src/convert.py --phase convert --node_size_multiplyer 5 --edge_weight_multiplyer 3 --edge_weight_ignore true --coord_multiplyer 10 \
    --node-name-prefix "N_" --filein "data/examples/NetLogo/netlogo world - cliques.csv" \
    --fileout "data/examples/Gephi/conversions/converted - netlogo world - cliques.graphml"
```


```bash
python src/convert.py --phase convert --node_size_multiplyer 5 --edge_weight_multiplyer 3 --edge_weight_ignore true --coord_multiplyer 10 \
    --node-name-prefix "N_" --filein "data/examples/NetLogo/netlogo world - SmallWorldWS.csv" \
    --fileout "data/examples/Gephi/conversions/converted - netlogo world - SmallWorldWS.graphml"
```
